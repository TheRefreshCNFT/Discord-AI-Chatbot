Can you provide the error message or describe the issue you encounter when trying to run `main.py`?\n3. Have you checked the dependencies and made sure that all required packages and libraries are installed?\n4. Does the script run successfully outside of the DDGS environment?\n\nPlease provide the necessary details, and I will do my best to help you resolve the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try the following general steps to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n1. Check the script for any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Make sure all required dependencies and libraries are installed.\n3. Try running the script in a different environment or on a different machine to isolate any hardware-specific issues.\n4.
